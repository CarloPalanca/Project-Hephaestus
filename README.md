# Project-Hephaestus
A 600 g, 10 × 10 cm mini-sumo robot built for precision and power. It features a 3-channel line sensor and an ultrasonic distance sensor for smart detection and edge awareness. Powered by slow yet high-torque DC motors for maximum pushing force, it also has a variant with dual matador flags driven by 180° servo motors for dynamic motion.
